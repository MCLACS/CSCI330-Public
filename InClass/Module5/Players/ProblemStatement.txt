Create a Player class that represents a basketball player.  Your class should keep track of the first name, last name, age, and position of the player.  Your Player class should also provide a method that overloads the << operator to print the data for a Player.  You should print a player using the following format:

	First Last (age)
	Position

Finally, create a main program that reads the five players stored in the provided players.txt file and prints them using the << operator.  When you print the players in the file you must print them in the following order:

	Point Guard
	Shooting Guard
	Power Forward
	Small Forward
	Center

The correct output is shown below:

Sally Shooter (19)
Point Guard

Alex Pall (26)
Shooting Guard

Kim Roth (28)
Power Forward

Fred Smith (24)
Small Forward

Tim Jones (22)
Center

You might find the code in unit 01-ProceduralVsOOP/oop to be helpful when you are writing the << opeartor.
