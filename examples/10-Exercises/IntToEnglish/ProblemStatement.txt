Write a program that asks the user to enter any positive integer and then breaks the integer into the number of ones, tens, hundreds, etc. contained in the number.  For example, if the user enter 4532, your program should output:

2 * 1
3 * 10
5 * 100
4 * 1000

You should not use strings to solve this problem. `Your program should produce an error if a valid positive integer is not entered.

HINT: You might find the userinput example form unit 04 to be helpful for this exercise.  You also might find the modulus (%) operator and integer division to be helpful.
