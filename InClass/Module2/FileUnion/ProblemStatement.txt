Write a function called union that takes references to two FileReader objects (from unit 04) and returns a vector of all of the lines that are contained in both files.  Next, create a main method that calls your function using the two files provided (names1.txt and names2.txt) and prints the result.  You will know if your function works if your main method prints Fred, Rick and Fran.
