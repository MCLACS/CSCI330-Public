Write a program that creates three different animals and asks them to speak.  
The animals should all derive from a common base class called AnimalBase.  
This class should have one pure virtual method called speak that takes no 
parameters and returns no value.  Each animal should implement the speak 
method by printing the animal's sound to the console.

Your program should work with the main.cpp provided.  
You cannot change this file.
